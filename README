TASK 05
WEB WEATHER APPLICATION

Task 5 of my journey with Prodigy Info-Tech focused on enhancing a weather app by integrating accurate, real-time weather data using an external API. The app fetches live weather conditions for any location, offering users up-to-date information in an easy-to-read format.

Key features of the app include:

🌡 Real-time temperature updates, displaying current temperatures for selected locations.
☁ Detailed weather conditions, such as sunny, cloudy, or rainy, updated dynamically based on real-time data.
🧭 Wind speed and direction information, providing users with comprehensive weather insights.
This project strengthened my skills in API integration, enabling seamless data fetching and updating within the app. Additionally, I focused on improving the UI/UX design to present weather information in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of how real-time data is processed and displayed efficiently.

I'm excited about how much I’ve grown in terms of both development and design, and I look forward to applying these skills in future projects! 🚀
